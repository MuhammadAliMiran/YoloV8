# Gun Detection using YOLOv8

This repository showcases the usage of YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, for detecting guns in images. The YOLOv8 model is implemented using the Ultralytics library, providing efficient and accurate object detection capabilities.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training, validation, and testing was obtained from Roboflow, a platform for managing computer vision datasets. The dataset consists of annotated images containing guns, enabling the YOLOv8 model to learn to detect guns accurately.

## Usage
- Set up Roboflow project and download dataset:Before running the code, set up a Roboflow project containing the gun detection dataset. Replace api_key, workspace, project, and other necessary parameters in the code with your Roboflow API key and project details.
- Training:Train the YOLOv8 model using the provided dataset. Adjust parameters such as the number of epochs and image size as needed for your specific use case.
- Validation:Validate the trained model's performance using the validation set. This step ensures the model generalizes well to unseen data.
- Prediction:Make predictions on new images using the trained YOLOv8 model. Adjust the confidence threshold (conf) as needed to control the precision-recall trade-off.

## Learning

Through working on this project, I gained several key insights and learnings:

- Understanding of how to implement YOLOv8 for object detection tasks using Ultralytics library.
- Familiarity with managing datasets using Roboflow API and integrating them into machine learning pipelines.
- Experience in training, validating, and fine-tuning deep learning models for specific use cases, such as gun detection.
- Insight into the challenges and nuances of object detection, including dataset annotation, model tuning, and evaluation metrics.
